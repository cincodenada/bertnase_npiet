.SH DESCRIPTION
.B npiet-foogol
translates foogol input to a piet program. So npiet-foogol creates a
picture from foogol source.  The picture is, well should be, a valid
piet program and can be executed, eg. by the npiet interpreter.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
print usage help and exit.
.TP
.B \-v
be somewhat verbose.
.TP
.B \-d
print debug output (lot's of more or less cryptic and mostly useless blurb).
.TP
.B \-w <n>
Sets a wrap-width in pixel. This gives the compiler a hint about a
block width to use when generating expressions or statements. 
.br
Usually code is generated left to right until the wrap-width is reached
and then to the left. To avoid codel overlaps in loops and conditionals, code
is generated with a virtual left border, but this wrap-width too.  
Here is lot of optimisation possible.
.TP
.B \-b <n>
Sets the base used by generating a number. The default is 7 and a
value greater or equal of 2 is acceptable.
.br
In a piet program the number of codels (here pixels) of a color block
represents a number.  To be able to push a large number on the stack
without wasting a lot of ink, the number is calculated and the given
base is used to do so.

.B \-o <filename>
Sets the output filename.  Default is npiet-foogol.png.
.TP
.B inputfile
The foogol program to read. Use a - to read from <stdin>.
.SH FILES
.B "npiet-foogol.png"
- default name of the piet program file to write. It is overwritten if
it exists.
