- npiet is an interperter for the piet programming language and

- npietedit is a very simple editor for small piet programs.

- npietedit-foogol is a ``foogol to piet'' compiler.


about the piet programming language please look at:

	http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html


and you find more about npiet at:

	http://bertnase.de/npiet


and a copy of the foogol (and cfoogol) postings, about a ``ALGOL-like
language'' definition is avail here:

	http://bertnase.de/html/foogol.html


to compile and install npiet and the additional programs and files run 

	./configure
	make
	make install

this installs the binaries npiet, npietedit and npiet-foogol,
together with the manpages npiet.1, npietedit.1 and npiet-foogol.1 .


if compiled with gd-lib and png-lib support (if avail), graphical
trace output can be created by npiet - great fun ;-)


npietedit is a Tk/Tcl program, so you need Tk/Tcl installed to run it.


npiet-foogol needs libgd to compile and run.

        # with a debian/ubuntu based host you can install libgd via
        sudo apt-get install libgd2-xpm-dev


a quick npiet-foogol and npiet test would be:

	echo 'begin prints ("Yo\n") end' | ./npiet-foogol -
	./npiet npiet-foogol.png

     or additionally to create a trace picture named npiet-trace.png:

	./npiet -tpic npiet-foogol.png


Have fun!
